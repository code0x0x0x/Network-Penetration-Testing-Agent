# Advanced Cyber Operations Agent

## Overview

This advanced cybersecurity agent developed by TheNullGod & code0x0x0x is designed for automated network reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and report generation. It integrates state-of-the-art AI using the Mixtral-8x7B model to perform tactical analysis and decision-making on network findings. The agent employs a combination of passive and active scanning techniques, stealth operations, and exploitation strategies.

## Features

- **Network Discovery:** Automatically detects local network ranges and conducts both passive and active scans using tools like Nmap.
- **Stealth Operations:** Activates stealth mode including MAC address rotation, random hostname assignment, and iptables adjustments to minimize detection.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes the local Mixtral-8x7B model for vulnerability prioritization, exploit chain suggestions, and operational security recommendations.
- **Exploitation Framework Integration:** Interfaces with Metasploit and other frameworks for targeted exploitation and persistence establishment.
- **Report Generation:** Produces intelligent reports in both STIX format and human-readable summaries.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Implements secure data transmission techniques via OpenSSL and cURL.

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** Python 3.7 or later is required.
- **Python Libraries:** Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
  - cryptography
  - stix2
  - pandas
  - nmap3
  - pyattck
  - reportlab
  - metasploit
  - vllm
  - transformers
  - logging (standard library)

- **System Utilities:**
  - `ip` command (for network interface detection)
  - `macchanger` for MAC address rotation
  - `iptables` for firewall rules
  - `openssl`, `curl`, and `ssh` for secure operations and tunneling
  - Other tools like `passivedns`, `nmap`, `mimikatz`, and `volatility` may be needed depending on the operational context.

## Setup

1. **Clone/Download the Repository:**
   Ensure you have all the files including the agent located in the `NullGPT Mixtral` directory.

2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   You can install required libraries using a requirements file if provided, or install them individually:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography stix2 pandas nmap3 pyattck reportlab metasploit vllm transformers
   ```

3. **Model Setup:**
   Place the Mixtral-8x7B model files in the directory `/app/models/mixtral` or update the model path in the script accordingly.

## Environment Variables

The agent relies on several environment variables for its configuration. Set these in your shell before running the agent:

- `EXFILTRATION_SERVER`: URL for data exfiltration (default is `http://localhost/upload`).
- `STEALTH_LEVEL`: Set to `stealth` to enable stealth mode operations.
- `MSFRPC_PASS`: Password for the Metasploit RPC client.
- `FIREWALL_IP`: IP address of the target firewall for bypass and scanning operations.

Example (Linux/Mac):
```bash
export EXFILTRATION_SERVER="http://localhost/upload"
export STEALTH_LEVEL="stealth"
export MSFRPC_PASS="your_msfrpc_password"
export FIREWALL_IP="192.168.1.1"
```

## Running the Agent

Navigate to the your directory and run the agent:

```bash
python3 nework-agent.py
```

The agent will perform the following operations:

1. **Stealth Activation:** Rotates MAC addresses, randomizes the hostname, and adjusts iptables rules if `STEALTH_LEVEL` is enabled.
2. **Advanced Network Discovery:** Conducts both passive and active scanning, analyzing network ranges and vulnerabilities.
3. **AI Analysis:** Uses the local AI model (Mixtral-8x7B) to generate tactical insights and exploit recommendations.
4. **Exploitation Phase:** Attempts to exploit identified vulnerabilities and establish persistence.
5. **Report Generation:** Creates reports including STIX formatted intelligence, human-readable summaries, and comprehensive security recommendations.

## Logging and Reports

- **Logging:** Operational logs are written to `agent.log`.
- **Real-Time Reporting:** Updates on operations are available in `report.txt`.
- **Generated Reports:**
  - `human_report.txt`: Summary of compromised targets.
  - `comprehensive_report.txt`: Detailed security recommendations.
  - `report.stix`: STIX formatted intelligence report.
